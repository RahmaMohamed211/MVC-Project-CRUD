ASP.NET Core MVC Project
Welcome to my first ASP.NET Core MVC Project! This project is a web application that showcases CRUD operations with a solid 3-Tier Architecture. 
The project emphasizes security, scalability, and clean code practices by utilizing advanced design patterns such as Dependency Injection and Unit of Work.
